# workshop-nutrition-tracker
A nutrition tracker built to teach the basics of frontend development using html, css, and javascript.

API website - https://developer.nutritionix.com/

After you have set up your API and filled in the app-id and app-key on script.js you can run open index.html in the terminal/shell to open the webpage in the browser.

open index.html will open the document in the browser even if the api is not set up and all of the functionality, including styling, will still work, however, searches will not return any data.
